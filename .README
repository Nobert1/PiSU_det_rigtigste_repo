Before interaction with a new database, create the following schemas and the trigger:

DROP TABLE Game;
CREATE TABLE if not exists Game (
gameID int auto_increment PRIMARY KEY,
SaveName varchar(45) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE if not exists Player (
playerID int NOT NULL,
gameID int references Game.gameID,
PlayerName varchar(45),
balance int NOT NULL,
position int,
injail boolean,
color varchar(45),
tokentype varchar(45),
Currentplayer boolean,
CONSTRAINT pk primary key (playerID, gameID),
CONSTRAINT fk FOREIGN KEY (gameID) REFERENCES Game (gameID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);


CREATE TABLE if not exists Utilities (
gameID int references Game.gameID,
ownerID int references Player.playerID,
utilityID int NOT NULL,
mortgaged boolean,
CONSTRAINT pk primary key (gameID, utilityID)
);

CREATE TABLE if not exists RealEstate  (
gameID int references Game.gameID,
ownerID int references Player.playerID ON DELETE CASCADE,
mortgaged boolean,
RealEstateId INT NOT NULL,
houses INT,
hotel boolean,
CONSTRAINT pk primary key (gameID, RealEstateId)
);


DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER delete_trigger BEFORE DELETE ON Game
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
DELETE FROM RealEstate WHERE RealEstate.gameID = old.gameID;
DELETE FROM Player WHERE Player.gameID = old.gameID;
DELETE FROM Utilities WHERE Utilities.gameID = old.gameID;
END $$
DELIMITER ;
